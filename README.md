# Ionic Angular Capacitor App

This is a simple mobile application built using Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor. The app features three default tabs.

## Features

1. **Tab 1 - Modal Window:**
   - The first tab contains a button labeled "Open Modal." Clicking this button opens a modal window with the title "Modal Window 1" and the text "Test."

2. **Tab 2 - Links and Details:**
   - The second tab presents a list of 3-5 links with arbitrary text. Clicking on any of these links navigates to a new page (not a modal window) displaying arbitrary information.

3. **Tab 3 - Placeholder:**
   - The third tab is intentionally left empty for further development or customization.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. **Run the App:**
   - Use `ionic serve` to launch the development server and preview the app in your browser.

3. **Explore and Customize:**
